# Steps to follow

It is assumed that the user has Docker installed. Installation steps for Docker can be found at "https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/".

1) Create a directory, eg "Meta_dir" 

2) Download all the folders (1 through 6 as well as the "Data" folder) into this directory

3) Each step should be run in sequence, i.e 1_ should be run first, followed by 2_, followed by 3_* etc

4) To run each step change into tha subdirectory, e.g for step 1 change into 1_prepare_data.

5) Each step is run by executing the run_*.sh script in that step, e.g for step 2 "bash run_race_metaanlysis.sh"
