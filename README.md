# Meta-analysis
A meta-analysis of curated breast cancer datasets

# Plan of action
# select genes based on n - 1 datasets
# FDR less than 0.05
# Using the excluded dataset, narrow the datset down to the selected genes and save that file with those gene expression values to tsv file
# save race/ER/PR/HER2 values
# perform cross validation
# AUROC value for the cross validation
